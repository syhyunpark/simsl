Description: The package simsl implements a single-index regression for optimizing an individualized dose rule from an observational study. To model interaction effects between baseline covariates and a treatment variable defined on a continuum, we employ two-dimensional penalized spline regression on an index-treatment domain, where the index is defined as a linear combination of the covariates (a single-index). An unspecified main effect of the covariates on the outcomes is allowed. A unique contribution of this work is in the parsimonious single-index parametrization specifically defined for the interaction effect term. We refer to Park, Petkova, Tarpey, and Ogden (2020) <doi: 10.1016/j.jspi.2019.05.008> (for the case of a discrete treatment) and "A single-index model with a surface-link for optimizing individualized dose rules" (pre-print, 2019) for detail of the method. The main function of this package is simsl().
